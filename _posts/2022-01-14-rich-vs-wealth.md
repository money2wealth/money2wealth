Sadly rich or Happily wealthy ?

Do you know why many rich people end up poor and wealthy stay wealthy for generations ? Have you always wanted to be rich? or Do you want to be wealthy? This is a confusion that is present in almost everyone's mind and we all get it mixed up. 

Before we go too far, a small exercise to see how you think ?


>Answer the questions below as best you can, 
*write your answer on a small sheet of paper.*

>of these 3 people, Who is rich?
a) Vijay Malya
b) Anil Ambani
c) Nirav Modi


>Of these 3 people, Who is wealthy?
a) Mukesh Ambani
b) Ratan Tata
c) Mahendar Singh Dhoni

What is your answer? For the first, if you said Vijay Malya or Anil Ambani or Nirav Modi you are correct. All three were rich, they are not rich anymore, they are in deep debt as they misused their richness. They all had large amounts of money with them Vijay Malya (11000 Crore), Anil Ambani (5500 Crore), Nirav Modi (8000 Crore) were the reported numbers. Now, they are either absconding from the country and owe huge amounts of debt to different banks and financial institutions or are struggling to return the money to their lenders. 

For the second, if you said a) Mukesh Ambani or b) Ratan Tata or c) Mahendra Singh Dhoni, you are correct, all 3 are wealthy. They were always disciplined in their spending, worked hard in their life and were fortunate to have the opportunity come their way.  Mukesh Ambani (60B USD), Ratan Tata (XXX Crore), MS Dhoni (YYY Crore). They live inspiring and happy lives.

So why is that 1 set of 3 were rich and lost it all, and the other 3 are wealthy and happy and flourishing and growing. It's because one focussed on being rich and enjoying the richness, while the other set focussed on building and growing wealth.


### Richness can be temporary, wealth stays for generations and lifetimes.

Richness alone brings immediate short term relief and happiness, being wealthy brings cumulative and compounding growth over a lifetime. 

Don't get me wrong, we need both richness and wealth. Being rich and using money with discipline helps us to obtain comforts of life, a good house, a good car, healthy and good quality food etc. Being wealthy helps us to generate more ways to earn money, build a safety net for ourselves and our children and families, and gives us comfort of mind that we have stability.

What does being rich look like? A wise and knowledgeable person will use their money to become mentally and physically healthy and be happy by doing good things and learning new skills.  A person misusing money will buy expensive car, buy gold jewelry, buy expensive alcohol, eat in expensive restaurants, go on luxury travels and as a result waste or squander the money.

A Wealthy person focuses his/her efforts on building assets (income generating real estate), invest in public company stocks, start and grow businesses, own lots of profit generating businesses while living a comfortable and happy life.

### Sadly rich and happily wealthy
Let's take another situation, we have 2 people, 1 is richness minded and the other is wealth minded. They both win 1 Crore INR in Kaun Banega Crorepati. What does their financial health look like in 3 years after winning?

The winner of Kaun Banega Crorepati becomes rich only to become poor again in 3 years due to poor choices.  You know why ? 
> input INR 100,00,000
40% tax cut -> 60,00,000
20% lavish vacation and lifestyle -> 40,00,000
20% expensive car -> 20,00,000
15% maintain expensive lifestyle ( petrol, shopping etc.) -> 5,00,000 ( aka back to square one)
At the end of 3 years -> 5,00,000

Wealth minded person invests and grows.
> input INR 100,00,000
40% tax cut -> 60,00,000
10% improve quality of life -> 50,00,000
10% support parents and family -> 40,00,000
Rest is invested with 15% annual compounding growth rat.
at the end of 3 years -> 60,83,500

The richness minded person changed his/her lifestyle and spent all the money. The wealth minded person grew his wealth to 60 Lakhs while also using money to bring happiness in life.

> It is upon us to choose a life of discipline and become wealthy or be rich and spend our money to gain a short term rich feeling.
